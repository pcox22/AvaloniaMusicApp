# AvaloniaMusicApp
A demonstration of the Avalonia Framework. This is my completed rendition of the Music Store sample provided as a learning tool for the framework. The tutorial can be found at the [Avalonia UI Website](https://docs.avaloniaui.net)

# Components
## C#
Coded in standard C#

## AXAML
Utilizes XAML to create a native Desktop Application

## Reactive UI
Many of the functions used to connect backend and frontend are built into the Reactive UI toolkit. This made creating Reactive Commands a breeze so they could be bound to UI elements later.

## Avalonia
As made clear by the title, this project was made using the Avalonia framework. It was created on JetBrains: Rider, and combined all of the above elements. The solution was built using Model View View Model (MVVM) software architecture: much of the backend was established in ViewModel files in C#, and their properties were connected properly to View files built in XAML.
